This is my assignment from my first year full-stack development course at the University of Birmingham.
This project implements the client and server components of the Jabber platform to provide users with efficient instant messaging services. The client is developed based on JavaFX technology, providing a graphical user interface (GUI) and user-friendly interactive experience. The server uses Java technology to interact with the database and communicate with the client through the Socket connection.

# Client
## Function Features
1. A user-friendly graphical user interface is implemented using the JavaFX framework.
2. Connect and process client-side user operations with back-end logic through the Controller.
3. Connect with the server based on Socket technology to realize data transmission and communication.
## Install and run
1. Make sure the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is installed.
2. Download and unzip the client code library.
3. Run the main application Main.java to start the Jabber platform client.

# Server
## Function Features
1. A Java-based server application is implemented to provide services and manage requests from clients.
2. Listen to the request from the client on the local (localhost) through the Socket connection, and process the corresponding data response.
3. Effective data interaction with databases for storing and retrieving user information and other related data.
## Install and run
1. Download and unzip the server code repository.
2. Configure database connection information to ensure that the server can interact with the database.
3. Run the main application, JabberMessage.java, to start the Jabber platform server

# Communication Protocol
This project uses a custom communication protocol for data transmission and communication between client and server. Protocol details can be found in the project source code.
